# 🍽️ Zomato Data Cleaning Project

Welcome to my second data cleaning project, where I worked with the **Zomato Restaurant Dataset** to clean and prepare real-world data for analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on preprocessing and cleaning the Zomato dataset to make it suitable for further data analysis, visualization, and insights. The dataset contains restaurant information such as names, locations, cuisines, ratings, and more.

## 🧹 Cleaning Steps Performed

Here are the major data cleaning tasks I performed:

- ✅ Removed unnecessary or irrelevant columns  
- ✅ Dropped duplicate records  
- ✅ Handled missing/null values  
- ✅ Cleaned and standardized text data  
- ✅ Formatted column names  
- ✅ Converted data types (e.g., float to int where needed)  
- ✅ Removed outliers and invalid values  
- ✅ Renamed columns for better readability  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a public Zomato dataset which includes information about thousands of restaurants, including:
- Restaurant name  
- Location and address  
- Cuisine type  
- Average cost  
- Online delivery availability  
- Ratings and reviews  

⚠️ **Note**: The dataset file `zomato.csv` is large, so it is not included directly in the repository.

## 📈 Outcome

After the cleaning process, the dataset is:
- Free of duplicates and nulls  
- Standardized for text-based columns  
- Ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling
